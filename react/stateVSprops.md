# State vs. Props

## State 

- Internal data, owned by component.

- Can be updated by the component's itself.

- Updating state causes component to re-render.

- Used to make components interactive.

## Props

- External data , passed by parent component.

- Similar to function parameters.

- Read-only.

- Receiving new props causes component to re-render. Usually,
when the parent's state has been updated.
